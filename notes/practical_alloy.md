# Structural Modelling

- Signature declaration seems like classes with inheritance
- Analysis commands can find design problems or spec errors as early as possible

  - `check` for validity (finds counterexamples)
- Instances from analysis show up as graph like structures
  - atoms/nodes have no intrinsic semantics

## Example - File System
