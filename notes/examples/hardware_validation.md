Setting: We want to run a series of tests on a new SKU of GPUs. Current testing methods follow a procedure but is mostly manual (least of all, swapping GPUs on different Devices Under Test). Our goal is to automate all tests that do not require manual intervention (ex. video playback at different resolutions, frame rates, codecs, etc).

What would a formal methods specification look like?
