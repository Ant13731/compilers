# Ideas

- We don't really want modelling examples/languages since those are intended to prove correctness of a system rather than actually execute a task
- We want simulation tasks - simulating the real world with sets, sequences, relations

  - Thus we need simulation examples
  - Our language is a simulation language

- Example idea
  - Ikea-like warehouse (collection of materials, screws, wood planks, etc)
    - recipies for building furniture
    - similar idea for baking/maintaining ingredients in a fridge
  - conways game of life
- ideas from chatgpt
  - Undo/redo on a text editor (uses sequences)
  - Checking permissions for users in a system
  - Directed graph problems using relations
  - Search tags in a webbrowser (filters, keywords, sorting, etc)
  - set of triples of the form (domain, relationship, range) - knowledge base for facts (kind of similar to drasil)
    - drasil also needs to maintain units for every numerical value/variable
  - prerequisite for courses with cycle detection
