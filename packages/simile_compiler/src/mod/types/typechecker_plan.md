- [ ] Type Refinement
    - Traits should have their own type rules (value rules?) ex. T[with min=4] < T[with min=1]
    - This is implicitly true since we check for type equality, but what about when both types have traits?
        - In some cases this wouldnt be true: ex. T[with min=1] != T[with max=1]. T's are subtypes of each other but not with traits on both. When check types is invoked, we check the subtyping rules for each Trait. We further assume that if one type has a trait that the other does not, the one with the extra trait is smaller
    - note some traits imply others - set of literal ints implicitly imposes a min/max bound
- [x] Powerset
    - Implicit, sets are generic
- [ ] Emptyset
    - Need to add trait Empty
- [ ] Emptyset Bottom
    - implement this in the set comparison

    - make Relation type inherit from Set, force element type to be a TupleType[BaseType, BaseType]
- [x] Bag Type
    - inherit from Relation type
- [x] Bag Enumeration
    - same as Set enumeration function

    - may be worth making this a type actually, help organize the generators/move code out of the optimizer...
    - symb table impl too
    - following n-ary functions can be a part of the QuantificationBody
    - in the type hierarchy, QuantificationBody's should be dependent on the operation
