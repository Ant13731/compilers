\section{Introduction}

From the categorization of species to the periodic table of elements, the organization and manipulation
of data is integral to all aspects of science and technology. Although the collection of data is not a
new field of research by any means, the advent of computerized systems, with the ability to transfer and use
terabytes of data within seconds, necessitates understandable and sensible organization structures.

Over the past 60 years, as computational resource restrictions have eased dramatically,
programming languages and software creation tools have evolved with increasingly better methods of dealing with data.
By viewing pieces of data through specific lenses, programmers can then write algorithms that operate on
any data matching the shape of those lenses, rather than the data itself. These lenses are more commonly referred to as
data types, which assign a type to a piece of data. As we will see later in this paper,
further abstractions over data types themselves enable extremely concise and readable code,
both for the programmer and computer.


the shape of the data rather than the data itself.

abstractions
to decompose large chunks of data into digestible pieces. By fitting these pieces of data into specific forms
(referred to as types), programmers can more easily create algorithms to make use of certain pieces of data.


From the categorization of species to the periodic table of elements, the organization and manipulation
of data has proven time and again to be a key player in the advancement of science and technology.



With the creation of modern computing and the advent of large language models capable of stringing
together hundreds of pieces of information within minutes, it is more important now than ever to



Data is one of the most important...
Data is fundamentally human.
In the modern age, although the collection of data has been largely automated through the use of
computerized systems, humans as a society are still

For generations, humans have been coming up with ideas to organize and manipulate data...

The topic of organizing and manipulation data is one of the key tenants of Computer Science.
Even in other areas of


As soon as you reach a higher level language than assembly, data types become important...
