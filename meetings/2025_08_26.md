# Agenda

# Research Tasks
- Gather more examples
    - Information Systems
        - Visitor info
        - Warehouse
        - Bookstore
        - Search page
        - Birthday book
    - Simulations
        - Game of life
        - 2D particle simulation
    - Algorithmic
        - Leetcode?
        - Tianyu's thesis?
    - With undefinedness?
- Prove TRS formally
    - equivalence
    - termination
    - confluence
    - predicate transformers
    - dont need to much, just state something about it
- Benchmarks/Examples comparison
    - Running time
    - Memory consumption
    - Big O results
- Executable specifications
    - theoretically commutative operators with non-commutative computations and (runtime) undefinedness
        - Eg. Short circuiting, overflow/underflow
        - Options:
            - Make no guarantees on order of evaluation
            - Upon seeing a runtime error in a short circuiting operator, try the next operation to see if it would have short circuited past the error
            - Evaluate all operations
            - Use SMT solver to prove equivalence of undefinedness in optimizer
        - TODO look up and summarize:
            - Dafny undefinedness (Rustan Leino Dafny book)
                - From language reference:
                    - Uses special assignment operator to catch (runtime) errors as they appear
                - Need to get book access - which one?
            - Event-B undefinedness
            - What about "best effort execution"? Has there been any precedent for this sort of approach to short-circuiting operations? Purely theoretical approach would be to evaluate all clauses and throw an error if even one of them is malformed. Should we do something like this too?

# Compiler Tasks
- Add rules to take advantage of relational subtypes
    - Review 5.3.6
- Test new TRS
- LLVM/MLIR for term rewriting output/codegen
    - And data structures
    - Need to finalize resulting AST (ex. post-optimization should have no quantification statements)
- Check that bound identifiers machinery works in all cases
- Get current examples executing

# Postponed Tasks
- Investigate egraphs for term rewriting - see starred repo from other toy compiler
- Constant folding in TRS - when to do it?
- Dealing with subset generators and powersets
- Jupyter
    - syntax highlighting
    - kernel/server

# Thesis Planning
1. Introduction
    1. Problem Statement
    2. Contributions (simplified)
    3. Readable/understandable to anyone with a bachelors - why is this interesting, what did u solve, soln?
2. Background/Related Work (convince the reader, broad terms, contributions)
    1. Specification Languages/Specification vs Execution?
        1. Event-B
    2. Set-based languages
    3. Abstract Data Types
    4. High Level Program Optimization (and Term Rewriting)
    5. What other solns exist with a timeline, contributions expanded, define standards from other literature
3. Motivation
    1. Examples
        1. Information Systems
        2. Simulations
        3. Algorithmically-intense
4. The Simile Language (design, etc.)
5. High Level Optimization in Simile - TRS Specification
6. Implementation
    1. Jupyter
7. Conclusion
    1. Put contribution into perspective with tech details (assume paper was read)
