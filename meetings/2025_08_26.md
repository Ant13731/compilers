# Agenda

# Research Tasks
- Gather more examples
    - Information Systems
        - Visitor info
        - Warehouse
        - Bookstore
        - Search page
        - Birthday book
    - Simulations
        - Game of life
        - 2D particle simulation
    - Algorithmic
        - Leetcode?

    - With undefinedness?
- Prove TRS formally
    - equivalence
    - termination
    - confluence
    - predicate transformers
- Benchmarks/Examples comparison
    - Running time
    - Memory consumption
    - Big O results
- Executable specifications
    - theoretically commutative operators with non-commutative computations and (runtime) undefinedness
        - Eg. Short circuiting, overflow/underflow
        - Options:
            - Make no guarantees on order of evaluation
            - Upon seeing a runtime error in a short circuiting operator, try the next operation to see if it would have short circuited past the error
            - Evaluate all operations
            - Use SMT solver to prove equivalence of undefinedness in optimizer
        - TODO look up and summarize:
            - Dafny undefinedness (Rustan Leino Dafny book)
            - Event-B undefinedness

# Compiler Tasks
- Add rules to take advantage of relational subtypes
- Test new TRS
- LLVM/MLIR for term rewriting output/codegen
    - And data structures
- Check that bound identifiers machinery works in all cases
- Get current examples executing

# Postponed Tasks
- Investigate egraphs for term rewriting - see starred repo from other toy compiler
- Constant folding in TRS - when to do it?
- Dealing with subset generators and powersets
- Jupyter
    - syntax highlighting
    - kernel/server
