# Agenda

- TRS implementation - show successful cardinality tests
  - What should be the accumulator function for sets? like for sum/cardinality, our accumulator is just addition, but maybe I should make a separate AST func for set accumulation?
- Remade the quantifier-to-for-loop rewrite transitions (show notebook)
- For the quantifier generator ~> for loop transitions, should we use disjunctive normal form or conjunctive normal form?
  - Current idea is to use DNF and maybe combine generators that are exactly the same
  - Handling variable renaming may be a challenge tho...
  - Ask for some examples of proper translations/cases for nested and/or-clauses
- I think this section is the most difficult, just need to work through all the quantifier rewrite rules, then we can start producing LLVM IR and begin a cycle of additional rewrite rules and IR testing
- 2 weeks left until presentation
  - what should be my focus? Not sure if jupyter integration will be ready, but basic demos from files -> IR should exist at a minimum
  - For next time, Ill start making a slideshow?
    - What topics do we need to cover?
      - Background
        - Abstract data types for ease of use (closeness to discrete math, easier proofs, etc.) and optimization (responsibility of the compiler to make decisions rather than baked into data type)
      - Motivating Examples
        - Visitor Info System
        - Warehouse
        - Game of Life
      - Method
        - Rewrite rules/TRS, including strategy
        - Compiler pipeline
      - Discussion
        - What goes here? alternatives? existing solutions?
      - Demo
      - Future work
        - Jupyter interaction
        - Tackling trees
