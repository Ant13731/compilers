# Agenda

- VeTSS summer school
  - What are summer schools like? Similar to workshops?
  - Will McMaster cover traveling to two events so close to one another?
- Course signup - need signature
- Review compiler progress
- TRS progress
  - found eqsat, minikanren libraries (eqsat is too new, minikanren was only updated yesterday after no updates in 2 years)
  - trying to handroll my own from baader, but trying to think of the best way to actually write out TRS rules (see notebook)
