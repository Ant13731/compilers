# Agenda

- Successful translation to rust (for cardinality test)
- Started adding relation rules
- see open issues below
- 2 weeks left until presentation
  - what should be my focus? Not sure if jupyter integration will be ready, but basic demos from files -> IR should exist at a minimum
  - For next time, Ill start making a slideshow?
    - What topics do we need to cover?
      - Background
        - Abstract data types for ease of use (closeness to discrete math, easier proofs, etc.) and optimization (responsibility of the compiler to make decisions rather than baked into data type)
        - What other people have done, why ours is different
        - Event B/spec techniques/ideas and principles behind modelling/spec langs - look at setL (for what not to do - executable set theory that failed)
      - Motivating Examples
        - Visitor Info System
        - Warehouse
        - Game of Life
      - Method
        - Rewrite rules/TRS, including strategy
        - Compiler pipeline
      - Demo - pretty print ast as algorithmic code - see p0
      - Discussion
        - What goes here? alternatives? existing solutions?
        - mem consumption/runtime
        - how to make it usable/keep it theoretical investigation? limits? guarantees for mem consumption and runtime? what would be possible? size of generated code, theoretical result of the input? judge by # of operators/nested of operators, relationship of generated code "size" to the "input"
      - Future work
        - Jupyter interaction
        - Tackling tree data structures
        - how to make it a useful tool? use with existing tools, change B code generator? potential applications, even if we dont actually want to do it

# Compiler Progress

- Open issues:
  - translating bags to relations - how to count them up without pre-evaluating them? Are compile time rewrites sufficient?
  - dealing with subsets and powersets
- Tasks:
  - TODO accumulator function for sets - maybe make a new AST node? Can just use rust inserts
- Postponed issues:
  - Singleton membership code generation - need special rewrite rule for free x in $x = e$ - could just exclude the rule for now and construct the full for loop
  - LLVM/MLIR target

## Legend

x - complete
\> - WIP/incomplete
< - complete, but no tests

## Status

- [x] Frontend
  - [x] Scanner
  - [x] AST
  - [x] Parser
  - [x] Bound/Free variable checks
  - [x] Scoping
  - [x] Type check pass
- [ ] Middle-end
  - [x] TRS design
  - [x] TRS infrastructure
  - [>] Add rules
  - [x] Break up rules/strategies into phases
  - [>] Test TRS
- [ ] Backend
  - [>] LLVM IR target - deferred, rust instead
  - [>] Pipeline trial (from plaintext to executable)
- [ ] Jupyter
  - [ ] Jupyter server for executing language - storing variables, using across multiple cells, etc
- Compiler addons progress
  - [ ] Better syntax error messages
  - [ ] Reverse compiler - AST-to-plaintext (formatter?)
  - [ ] Syntax highlighting
    - [ ] Design
    - [ ] VSCode
    - [ ] Jupyter
  - [ ] Target multiple architectures
- Other
  - [ ] Benchmarks against other languages
    - [ ] Implement examples in Python
    - [ ] Implement examples in Haskell
    - [ ] Implement examples in Rust
    - [ ] Implement examples in C
  - [ ] Test against AI-generated code
    - [ ] Need a fair prompt for each example

# Notes

- complexity measurements - big o notation - size of input vs size of output
- runtime guarantees, intermediate memory
- do all the relation rules (except composition might be tricky)
